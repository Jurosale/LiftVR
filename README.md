Taking place in an elevator, Lift is a narrative VR game told through the eyes of the lone operator. Using the HTC Vive, create gestures to interact with guests, take individuals to their designated floor (or not), and determine how the story will impact all involved. 

Code Samples - contains some of my best/cleanest work as of the current version.

Ver. 1 Code - contains all my contributions from the first version (demo) of the game.  

Note: LiftVR is a work in progress and went through plenty of revisions. Ver. 1 (demo) available now.
